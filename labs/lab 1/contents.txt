Hello!

I was really interested to learn that you had an internship at IBM as a sophomore. 
This is something I'm also aiming to achieve this year, and I would greatly appreciate any 
insights or advice you might have. It's extremely impressive to have accomplished something 
like that so early in your career.

I'm excited to be in your class and I am looking forward to a great semester!

Thank you,

Christian Farrell
